# Collagesite
This is my first project, which I made for the first time when I learned HTML and CSS,
used the basic hover and click change effect,
and used various HTML elements that allowed me to learn how to create the basic structure of a website. 
By doing this, I gained knowledge about how alignment and padding are important.Â
